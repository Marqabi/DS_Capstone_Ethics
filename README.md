**Description**: Create an R package of the Saudi Arabia Weather History dataset to make it easy to deal with and extract information from. Moreover, it will be connected to my major (Mechanical Engineering) by making functions on solar energy and wind energy based on the parameters available in the dataset (Temperature, Wind and Humidity). i.e. the feasibility of installing a solar PV/wind turbine system in a city.


**Data Description:**
The data collected multiple weather parameters for 13 regions of Saudi Arabia. The observations are taken every hour for 3 years (2017,2018 and 2019).
